          <article class="front-text">
            <p>
              Industrial automation is the application of technology to control
              and monitor industrial processes, reducing the need for human
              intervention. These technologies can include robotics, sensing and
              control devices, and computer systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal of industrial automation is to improve efficiency,
              productivity, quality, and control of manufacturing processes
              while reducing costs. This technology has transformed
              manufacturing and production processes across a wide range of
              industries, including automotive, mining, oil and gas, and food
              and beverage. With continued advancements in technology,
              industrial automation is expected to play an even more critical
              role in shaping the future of manufacturing.

              <p>
                As an electronic engineering intern, I have gained invaluable
                experience in the field of industrial automation while working
                on various projects. The biggest project I was involved in was
                the plant optimization project for Mimosa Mining Company, which
                took place from February 13 to March 24, 2023. My contributions
                in this project included developing customized solutions that
                improved efficiency and safety at the plant, resulting in
                significant cost savings for the client.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to the Mimosa project, I was also involved in
                commissioning an Allen Bradley PowerFlex 753 drive and hoist
                maintenance at a gold mine. These experiences have given me a
                thorough understanding of industrial automation and how it can
                be applied to different contexts.
              </p>
              <p>
                To further improve myself, I have completed several online
                courses, including the Electricity Distribution course offered
                by the National University of Singapore on edX. I have also
                completed courses on industrial power distribution and SI low
                voltage drives from Rockwell Automation University.

                With my background in electronic engineering, knowledge in
                industrial automation, and passion for clean energy solutions, I
                am eager to take on new challenges and opportunities. I am
                confident that my skills, combined with the experiences I have
                gained so far, will make a significant contribution to any team
                and project I become part of.
